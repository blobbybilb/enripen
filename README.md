## How it works/will work
There will be a browser extension that uses the API to automatically suggest redirects when you encounter a broken link. A user would also be able to submit new destination links for a broken link, and upvote links submitted by others that work.

---

Uses the Fresh framework, with Flowbite components, and Hono (embedded inside a Fresh route) for the API.

GPLv3 License, all open source libraries used have their own licenses.

The Demo UI is pretty basic because I was going to make a browser extension that uses the API but ran out of time ðŸ˜…. I'll make the browser extension at some point...

Not sure what "All code must be created during the event" means exactly, but I did use some open source libraries (fresh, flowbite, and hono). If that disqualifies it then I have no problem :)
